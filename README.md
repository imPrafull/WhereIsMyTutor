# NativeScript with Angular App

    
  Communication with the teachers is a very important aspect of learning for the
students. Students sometimes need to communicate with teachers even outside class.
However, no facilities exist in any colleges or institutes to help students meet teachers outside
class and discuss doubts. Also, most of the colleges donâ€™t have any records about the
whereabouts of teachers in the institute during working hours. If students need to
communicate with teachers outside class, then it becomes a huge problem finding the teacher
in such large colleges/institutes.
  This mobile app will resolve this issue by giving regular updates regarding the
whereabouts of every teacher within the institute. Not only will the students know where the
teachers are, but also check if they are busy in lectures, how many lectures will they be busy
for and accordingly try to communicate with them. Even the coordinators of the teachers can
observe the lectures conducted by individual teachers.
